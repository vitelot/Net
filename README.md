# Net

"Net" is a program that performs statistical calculations on
networks (graphs).
It may also create networks by using the Fitness model formalism as
in Ref. "G. Caldarelli et al., PRL 89, 258702 (2002)"


In order to run full matrix diagonalizations you must have
GSL installed (see INSTALL file).
You can still calculate partial spectra using lanczos methods.

In order to generate tag co-occurrence networks from a file containing
a list of Tag Assignments, a perl interpreter must be installed.

If you have XMGRACE installed you can see results on the fly
by switching on the RUN_GRACE flag.

If you have QT 3 installed you can use the graphical panel
to edit the initialization file NET.INI.

If you have 'graphviz 1.8.10' (http://www.graphviz.org/) you can
display the network on screen.
In alternative you may use 'Guide' (http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~kobourov/GRIP/).

If you like to receive updates of the program, or send suggestions, or
notify bugs, please sen me an e-mail to the addresses specified in the
"AUTHORS" file.
