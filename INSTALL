Basic Installation
==================

just run 'gmake' (you must have 'gmake', simple 'make' may not work)

if you DO NOT have the Gnu Scientific Libraries (GSL) installed on your machine,
you can still compile the program, but FULL spectral calculations will 
be off.
In this case you MUST comment out the first line in file 'sources/Makefile'.

If you do not have LAPACK and BLAS installed comment out the second line in file
'sources/Makefile'

Change the third line of file 'sources/Makefile' accordingly

[
  Are you joking? You do not know how to comment code lines? :-O
  Well, in C you have to embed the line to be commented with "/*" and "*/", 
    eg. /* LINE TO COMMENT */; Alternatively some compilers 
    accept the c++ commenting style, then
    simply append "//" at the beginning of the line;
  in perl and in makefiles, put the "#" symbol at the beginning of the line.
